  abstract: The large water requirements of L. together with an increase in temperature\
    and drought events imply the need for irrigation in the driest areas of its distribution\
    range. Generous watering may reduce grape quality so irrigation should be precisely\
    regulated through the development of new methods of accurate irrigation scheduling\
    based on plant \'91stress sensing\'92. Two new methods, the reflectivity in the S-band\
    and the broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy, can be used as non-invasive and reproducible\
    techniques for the study of plant water relations in . On one hand, the measurement\
    of reflectance at frequencies around 2.4GHz gives an excellent accuracy when the\
    changes in the existing area (S) between two reflectance curves are correlated\
    with the relative water content (RWC). On the other hand, an improvement of the\
    broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy based on the enlargement of the analysis frequency\
    window provides, apart from the determination of the turgor loss point (TLP),\
    additional information about the leaves without additional computational cost\
    or additional leaf information requirements. Before TLP, the frequency associated\
    with the maximum transmittance (f/fo), the macroscopic elastic constant of the\
    leaf in the Z direction (c33) and, specially, the variation of the attenuation\
    coefficient with the frequency (n), were highly correlated with changes in RWC.\
    Once turgor is lost, a shift in the parameters directly related to the attenuation\
    of the signal was also observed. The use of both techniques allows for a more\
    convincing knowledge of the water status in .\

  abstract: The turgor loss point (TLP), which is considered a threshold for many\
    physiological processes, may be useful in plant-breeding programs or for the selection\
    of reforestation species. Obtaining TLP through the standard pressure-volume (p-v)\
    curve method in a large set of species is highly time-consuming and somewhat subjective.\
    To solve this problem, we present an objective and a less time-consuming technique\
    based on the leaf resonance able to calculate the relative water content (RWC)\
    at TLP (RWCTLP). This method uses air-coupled broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy\
    to obtain the sigmoidal relation between RWC and the standardized resonant frequency\
    (f/fo). For the 13 species measured, the inflexion point of the RWC-f/fo relationship\
    ( ) was not statistically different from the value of RWC at the TLP obtained\
    with the p-v curves (RWCTLP p-v).\

  abstract: Described here is the application of a technique based on the excitation,\
    sensing and spectral analysis of thickness resonances of plant leaves using air-coupled\
    and wide-band ultrasound pulses (150-900 kHz) to monitor variations in leaf properties\
    caused by plant responses to different environmental stimuli, such as a sudden\
    variation in light intensity (from 2000 to 150 $\\mu$mol m(-2) s(-1)), sudden watering\
    after a drought period, and along the diurnal cycle (3-5 days, with continuous\
    variation in light intensity from 150 to 2000 $\\mu$mol m(-2) s(-1) and change\
    in temperature of about 5\'b0C). Four different widely available species, both monocots\
    and dicots and evergreen and deciduous, with different leaf features (shape, size,\
    thickness, flatness, vascular structure), were selected to test the technique.\
    After a sudden decrease in light intensity, and depending on the species, there\
    was a relative increase in the thickness resonant frequency from 8% to 12% over\
    a 25- to 50-min period. After sudden watering, the relative increase in the resonant\
    frequency varied from 5% to 30% and the period from 10 to 400 min. Finally, along\
    the diurnal cycle, the measured relative variation is between 4% and 10%. The\
    technique revealed differences in both the amplitude of the frequency oscillations\
    and the kinetics of the leaf response for different species and also within the\
    same species, but for specimens grown under different conditions that present\
    different cell structures at the tissue level. The technique can be equally applied\
    to the leaves of any species that present thickness resonances.\

  issue: July 2020\
  abstract: In the present study, the use of the air-coupled ultrasonic technique\
    has been analysed as a new tool for the contactless assessment of the avocado\
    post-harvest textural modifications during ripening. Thus, ultrasonic parameters,\
    such as maximum wave amplitude and ultrasound velocity, and textural ones, such\
    as hardness, elastic modulus and relaxation capacity, were measured on avocado\
    slices. During ripening, avocado reduced its elastic modulus (from 2.29 \'b1 0.75\
    to 0.16 \'b1 0.08 MPa), became softer and became more viscoelastic, which was well\
    described from zero and first-order kinetic models. These changes increased ultrasound\
    attenuation, decreasing the maximum amplitude of the ultrasonic signal (from 336.6\
    to 55.4 V/m), while the ultrasonic velocity remained constant, between 320.1 \'b1\
    6.9 and 316.4 \'b1 82.6 m/s. Thereby, the maximum ultrasonic amplitude, which adequately\
    correlated with textural parameters (ravg = 0.85), could be used to assess the\
    post-harvest ripening on avocado slices.\

  abstract: ' 2016 IEEE. The potential of additive manufacturing (AM) to revolutionize\
    aspects of industrial production is widely recognized. AM can create objects with\
    non-uniform properties by varying the ratio between deposited materials or altering\
    the internal structure of the object. Amongst many possibilities, such AM objects\
    could benefit the design and fabrication of different passive components of ultrasonic\
    transducers, e.g. backing material, lenses and matching layers. The acoustic properties\
    of AM objects produced using the Polyjet and Fused Deposition Methods were characterized.\
    Initial results suggest that these technologies can easily produce objects with\
    a wide range of tuned acoustic properties by varying either the internal structure\
    or the material composition.'\

  abstract: 'Non-contact and non-invasive materials characterization constitutes\
    an important milestone especially in cases where strong restrictions are mandatory,\
    such as: monitoring of fabrication processes in uncured materials, testing samples\
    under limited access, characterizing materials that can be altered due to contact,\
    etc. As consequence of the advance in air-coupled ultrasonic transducers, a technique\
    such as Non-Contact Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NC-RUS) was developed. This\
    technique has been successfully applied in plant leaves characterization. Consequently,\
    it was proved that effective parameters of plant leaves obtained using Non-Contact\
    Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy enables an accurate estimation of plant water\
    status. Nevertheless, the great potential shown by this technique was limited\
    regarding some concerns not yet studied, such as: heterogeneity in leaf tissues,\
    oblique incidence of the ultrasonic wave in the leaves and measurements on leaves\
    attached to the plant. Therefore, this work is focused on the application of this\
    technique in cases not studied so far, such as: quantifying and monitoring leaf\
    acoustic parameters of different species while inducing changes in abiotic factors\
    such as light and water, establishing the relationship between elastic parameters\
    obtained by ultrasonic measurements and the microstructure of plant tissues, extracting\
    mechanical parameters of each layer within the leaf and generating and detecting\
    shear waves in plant tissues. Results collected in this work show the variation\
    in the mechanical of plant leaves attached to the plant at ultrasonic frequencies,\
    as a consequence of their response under light and watering alterations. Furthermore,\
    elastic values obtained using ultrasonic techniques that propagate shear and guided\
    waves in plant tissues reveal a link between them and the microstructure observed.\
    Additionally, acoustic parameters from different layers within the sample at ultrasonic\
    frequencies were extracted, both at normal and oblique incidence in wideband (\\[0.1\
    \'96 1.6\\] MHz). This was demonstrated not only in plant leaves but also in synthetic\
    materials. From this work, we conclude that Non-Contact Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy\
    (NC-RUS) technique is a powerful tool for characterization, monitoring and control\
    of plants in the ecophysiology field. Moreover, it demonstrates that the NC-RUS\
    technique and procedures developed in this thesis work, adds a significant value\
    to materials characterization not only in synthetic materials but also in biological\
    tissues such plant leaves, where it is possible to infer the microstructure in\
    a non-destructive and non-invasive way. v'\
